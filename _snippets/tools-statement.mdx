ProjectDiscovery produces a suite of open source tools tailored for offensive security: security engineers, bug bounty hunters, and red teamers. Our toolkit is structured around three distinct layers to optimize your security assessment and penetration testing processes. We also provide utilities and libraries as building blocks for an offensive security or bug bounty hunting program.
