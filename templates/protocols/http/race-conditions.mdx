Race Conditions are another class of bugs not easily automated via traditional tooling. Burp Suite introduced a Gate mechanism to Turbo Intruder where all the bytes for all the requests are sent expect the last one at once which is only sent together for all requests synchronizing the send event.

We have implemented **Gate** mechanism in nuclei engine and allow them run via templates which makes the testing for this specific bug class simple and portable.

To enable race condition check within template, `race` attribute can be set to `true` and `race_count` defines the number of simultaneous request you want to initiate.

Below is an example template where the same request is repeated for 10 times using the gate logic.

```yaml
id: race-condition-testing

info:
  name: Race condition testing
  author: pdteam
  severity: info

http:
  - raw:
      - |
        POST /coupons HTTP/1.1
        Host: {{Hostname}}

        promo_code=20OFF        

    race: true
    race_count: 10

    matchers:
      - type: status
        part: header
        status:
          - 200
```

You can simply replace the `POST` request with any suspected vulnerable request and change the `race_count` as per your need, and it's ready to run.

```bash
nuclei -t race.yaml -target https://api.target.com
```

**Multi request race condition testing**

For the scenario when multiple requests needs to be sent in order to exploit the race condition, we can make use of threads.

```yaml
    threads: 5
    race: true
```

`threads` is a total number of request you wanted make with the template to perform race condition testing.


Below is an example template where multiple (5) unique request will be sent at the same time using the gate logic.

```yaml
id: multi-request-race

info:
  name: Race condition testing with multiple requests
  author: pd-team
  severity: info
