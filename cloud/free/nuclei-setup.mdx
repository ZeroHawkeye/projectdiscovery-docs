## Overview

Connecting to the free tier of PDCP requires setting up Nuclei to run your scans. You'll need to install Go, update your $PATH, and install Nuclei. Steps for each of those configurations are below. 

### Install Go

ProjectDiscovery runs on any operating system that supports Go, but these steps use Linux. 

For instructions on installing Go for an OS besides Linux [check out this post on our blog](https://blog.projectdiscovery.io/getting-started-with-projectdiscovery-in-linux-and-windows/) 
or refer to the installation instructions [available through the Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the latest version">
  Download and install [the latest version of Go](https://go.dev/doc/install).
  </Step> 
  <Step title="Verify the version">
  After downloading and installing run `go version` to verify that you are running the latest version (_v 1.21 at the time of writing_) 
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Update your $PATH

PATH is an environment variable on UNIX systems to define which directories contain executable programs. 
The variable is set within the config file for your particular shell.

To run Nuclei the folder where it resides needs to be in the PATH. ProjectDiscovery binaries are stored in the go/bin directory which is usually in the home directory. 

_Note: This folder is not automatically added to your PATH. Refer to the steps below to update it manually._

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify your GOPATH">
    To verify your GOPATH Run `go env | grep GOPATH` in your terminal and copy the output path. 
    You may need to add a `/bin` to the end of this path for it to work correctly. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open your shell config file">
    Open the shell config file for your shell in an editor (this example refers to nano). The command is `nano ~/.zshrc` for zsh or `nano ~/.bashrc` for bash. 
    
    At the bottom of the file, add `export PATH=”$PATH:insert/go/path/here/bin”`, replacing `insert/go/path/here` with the GOPATH from Step 1.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reset your terminal">
    Run `source ~/.zshrc` or `source~/.bashrc` to reset your terminal and reload it with the new config added. 
    You can also just close your terminal and open it again for this to take effect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify your updated PATH">
    Your PATH should be updated. 
    Type `$PATH` to check that the go binary directory is added to the end.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Install Nuclei

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Nuclei with Go">
    From your terminal run the following command `go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm installation">
    To confirm installation, on your terminal run `nuclei -h` to see the list of options and flags available.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

After setting up Nuclei you will need to create your PDCP account. Head to the [PDCP Setup](/cloud/free/pdcp-setup) for the next steps in the PDCP Free User Guide.
