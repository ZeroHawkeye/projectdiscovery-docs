## Overview

For users who want to apply some additional settings, ProductDiscovery Cloud Platform includes support in the PDCP Free for some additional integration and scan options. Those options are outlined below.

If you have questions or need assitance, reach out to us through any of the [Help options](/help).

## Advanced Integration Options 

### Setting API key via environment variable

To avoid entering your API key through the command line you can set it via environment variable. Note: Your configured PDCP API key stored in `$HOME/.pdcp/credentials.yaml`

```sh
export PDCP_API_KEY=XXXX-XXXX
```

### Enable scan result upload by default

If you want all your scans to automatically upload results to PDCP, enable the `ENABLE_CLOUD_UPLOAD` environment variable.

```sh
export ENABLE_CLOUD_UPLOAD=true
```

### Disabling PDCP upload warnings

To suppress warnings about result uploads, disable the `DISABLE_CLOUD_UPLOAD_WRN` environment variable.

```sh
export DISABLE_CLOUD_UPLOAD_WRN=true
