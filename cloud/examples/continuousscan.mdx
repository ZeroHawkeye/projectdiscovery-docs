## Summary 

PDCP scanning focuses on providing speed and accuracy around the vulnerabilities we identify. We want to ensure that you results are not filled with noise and help focus on the exploitable vulnerabilities that reflect the greatest risk. 

To set up continuous scanning you will need:

- The assets you care about. Check out our [What is exposed?](/cloud/examples/addassets) use case to add your assets.
- A scan schedule to check for recent changes that may reflect new vulnerabilities.
- Notifications to your preferred channels (Ticketing or Alerts!) *By default, these alerts are sent to email.*
  - Check out the [Scan Integrations](/cloud/scanning/integrations) for details.

With these things configured, the Cloud Platform can continuously run scans for you to keep your environment protected. 

## Create a Continuous Scan

Follow the steps below to create a new continuous scan. 

*Note: To include an alert or ticket creation as part of the scan you will need to 
have configured an integration. You can add an integration during the scan setup below or update an existing scan to add the integration.* 


<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Scans">
    Navigate to https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/scans and select **Create New Scan** to open the scan creation workflow. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Assets and Templates">
    Select (or add) the assets you want to include in your scheduled scan. 
    
    Click **Next** and select the templates you want to use for this scan.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scan Frequency">
    Give the scan a name and select your scan frequency to configure how often you want this scan to run. 

     - *You have to set up a schedule to enable a continuous scan.*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrations">
    Select **Integrate** to choose an existing Integration, or configure the new integration you want to use with this scan. 
    
    - *You can also update this scan after it is created to add the Integration.*
  </Step>  

</Steps>

## What's Next?

Once your scan has completed successfully the scan results will be available on the main **Results** tab as part of your full results. 
Select the individual scan you just created from the **Scans** page to see the results for the individual scan. 

Explore these results to learn more about any vulnerabilities we identified and the details around the timing, templates, severity and more.
